    "Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda. All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as *area code*, followed by a seven-digit local number. The first three digits of the local number represent the *exchange code*, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the *subscriber number*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format is usually represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(NXX)-NXX-XXXX\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code (1) if present.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the inputs\n",
    "- `+1 (613)-995-0253`\n",
    "- `613-995-0253`\n",
    "- `1 613 995 0253`\n",
    "- `613.995.0253`\n",
    "\n",
    "should all produce the output\n",
    "\n",
    "`6139950253`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.\n",

    "## Version compatibility\n",
    "Julia 1.0 and 0.7 are the only supported Julia versions on Exercism.\n",
    "For the most part, the test suites and solutions should be compatible to 0.6, but you will have to change `using Test` back to `using Base.Test` in the `runtests.jl` file.\n",
    "Note that 0.7 and 1.0 are almost identical, except for deprecation warnings, which have all been removed in 1.0.\n",
