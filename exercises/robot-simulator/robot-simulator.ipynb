    "A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robots have three possible movements:\n",

    "- turn left\n",
    "- advance\n",
    "\n",
    "Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular\n",
    "direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,\n",
    "e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the\n",
    "testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which\n",
    "direction it is pointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The letter-string \"RAALAL\" means:\n",
    "  - Turn right\n",
    "  - Advance twice\n",
    "  - Turn left\n",
    "  - Advance once\n",
    "  - Turn left yet again\n",
    "- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream\n",
    "  of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.\n",
