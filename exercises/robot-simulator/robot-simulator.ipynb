    "Write a robot simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robots have three possible movements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- turn right\n",
    "- turn left\n",
    "- advance\n",
    "\n",
    "Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular\n",
    "direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,\n",
    "e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the\n",
    "testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which\n",
    "direction it is pointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The letter-string \"RAALAL\" means:\n",
    "  - Turn right\n",
    "  - Advance twice\n",
    "  - Turn left\n",
    "  - Advance once\n",
    "  - Turn left yet again\n",
    "- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream\n",
    "  of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.\n",

    "## Version compatibility\n",
    "Julia 1.0 and 0.7 are the only supported Julia versions on Exercism.\n",
    "For the most part, the test suites and solutions should be compatible to 0.6, but you will have to change `using Test` back to `using Base.Test` in the `runtests.jl` file.\n",
    "Note that 0.7 and 1.0 are almost identical, except for deprecation warnings, which have all been removed in 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Incomplete Solutions\n",
    "It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.\n"
