This is a good exercise to experiment with non-standard string literals and metaprogramming.

A short introduction to non-standard string literals can be found in this [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20170625222109/https://iaindunning.com/blog/julia-unicode.html). A detailed metaprogramming guide can be found in the [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/).

You can extend your solution by adding the functionality described below.

Bonus A only requires basics as outlined in the blog post. Bonus B requires significantly more knowledge of metaprogramming in Julia.

## Bonus A
Implement a string literal that acts as `ROT13` on the string:
```julia
R13"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" == "nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm"
```

## Bonus B
Implement string literals `R<i>`, `i = 0, ..., 26`, that shift the string for `i` values:
```julia
R0"Hello, World!" == "Hello, World!"
R4"Testing 1 2 3 testing" == "Xiwxmrk 1 2 3 xiwxmrk"
R13"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" == "nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm"
```
