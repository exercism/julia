    "# Complex Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.\n",
    "The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.\n",
    "The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:\n",
    "`(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,\n",
    "`(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication result is by definition\n",
    "`(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is\n",
    "`1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:\n",
    "`(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raising e to a complex exponent can be expressed as `e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`, the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following operations:\n",
    " - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,\n",
    " - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julia Base implementation of complex numbers can be found here: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/complex.jl.\n",

    "You can work on the bonus exercises by changing `@test_skip` to `@test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus A\n",
    "Implement the exponential function on complex numbers `exp(::ComplexNumber)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus B\n",
    "Implement `jm` analogous to `im` so that `1 + 1jm == ComplexNumber(1, 1)`.\n",

    "## Version compatibility\n",
    "Julia 1.0 and 0.7 are the only supported Julia versions on Exercism.\n",
    "For the most part, the test suites and solutions should be compatible to 0.6, but you will have to change `using Test` back to `using Base.Test` in the `runtests.jl` file.\n",
    "Note that 0.7 and 1.0 are almost identical, except for deprecation warnings, which have all been removed in 1.0.\n",

    "## Submitting Incomplete Solutions\n",
    "It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.\n"
