# Complex Numbers

A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.

Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.

The Julia Base implementation of complex numbers can be found here: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/complex.jl.

You can work on the bonus exercises by changing `@test_skip` to `@test`.

## Bonus A
Implement the exponential function on complex numbers `exp(::ComplexNumber)`.

## Bonus B
Implement `jm` analogous to `im` so that `1 + 1jm == ComplexNumber(1, 1)`.
