# Introduction

The entire Julia track will require you to treat your solution like small libraries, i.e. you need to define functions, types etc. which will then be run against a test suite.
For that reason, we will introduce named functions as the very first concept.

## Functions

%{concept:functions}

## Integers and Arithmetic operations

%{concept:integer-introduction}

## Comments

%{concept:comments}

## Types

Depending on which other programming languages you know, you may expect parameters, variables or return values to have explicit type annotations.
For now, assume that Julia will infer the types automagically and don't worry about them, we will get to the specifics of the type system in later exercises.
