# Instructions append

You may (or may not!) want to call the function `permutations(a, t)` from [Combinatorics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Combinatorics.jl) in your solution.

- If working either in the online editor or locally with `Combinatorics.jl` installed in your environment, `permutations(a, t)` is already in the namespace, but you would normally need to add one of: `using Combinatorics` or `using Combinatorics: permutations` to your solution file.
- If working locally, without `Combinatorics.jl` installed in your environment, you can uncomment the relevant code in `permutations.jl` and add `include("permutations.jl")` at the top of your solution file to access `permutations(a, t)`. You will also need to comment out or remove the line `using Combinatorics: permutations` in `runtests.jl`.
