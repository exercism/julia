# Instructions append

You may (or may not!) want to call the function `permutations(a, t)` from [Combinatorics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Combinatorics.jl) in your solution.
If you would like to use it, you can include the **read-only** file `permutations.jl` with `include("permutations.jl")`.
