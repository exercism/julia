# Instructions

`(3, 4, 5)` and `(5, 12, 13)` are both Pythogorean triplets.
A Pythagorean triplet is three natural numbers `(a, b, c)` such that: `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` and `a < b < c`.

In this exercise you must find all Pythagorean triplets that sum to a target value `N` and return them in ascending order.

## Examples

For `N = 24`, there is one triplet that sums to 24: `(6, 8, 10)`.

For `N = 60`, there are two triplets that sum to 60: `(10, 24, 26)` and `(15, 20 , 25)`. You should return them in that order.
