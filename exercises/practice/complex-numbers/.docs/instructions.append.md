# Instructions append

The Julia Base implementation of complex numbers can be found here: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/complex.jl.

## Bonus A
You can work on the bonus exercises involving arithmetic between real numbers and complex numbers by uncommenting:
`# enable_realcomplex_tests = true` in the stub `complex-numbers.jl` or in `runtests.jl`

## Bonus B
You can work on the bonus exercises between real numbers and complex numbers by uncommenting:
`# enable_syntaxsugar_tests = true` in the stub `complex-numbers.jl` or in `runtests.jl`
Then, implement `jm` analogous to `im` so that `1 + 1jm == ComplexNumber(1, 1)`.
