# Introduction

## General guidance

The list of factors can include 0. There are of course infinite multiples of zero less than the limit, but they all sum to 0, so we would not like to count them. You can filter the zeros within your loops (as shown in the approaches below), or you can filter them from `factors` in advance like this:

```julia
# There are infinite multiples of 0 within any limit, but they all sum to
# 0, so remove them.
factors = filter(≠(0), factors)
```

## Approach: summing a set

In this approach we find every multiple less than the limit for each factor. We add them all to a `Set` to remove duplicates and then sum the set.

```julia
function sum_of_multiples(limit, factors)
    multiples = Set{Int}()
    for f in factors
        f == 0 && continue
        multiple = f
        while multiple < limit
            push!(multiples, multiple)
            multiple += f
        end
    end
    sum(multiples)
end
```

We specify that the `Set` will contain `Int` by writing `Set{Int}`. This is necessary so that `sum` knows how to sum the empty set (an empty set of integers has a sum of 0, but if the set has an unknown type then we cannot know it's sum).

We could also have used a `BitSet` here instead of a `Set`, which is usually the better option when working with a set of integers. To use a `BitSet` replace `Set{Int}()` on line 2 with `BitSet()`.

## Approach: finding remainders

Another option is to test every integer between 1 and (limit - 1) to see if it's divisible by any of our factors:

```julia
function sum_of_multiples(limit, factors)
    acc = 0
    for x in 1:limit-1
        for f in factors
            if f ≠ 0 && x % f == 0
                acc += x
                break
            end
        end
    end
    acc
end
```

We can reduce that to one line like so:

```julia
function sum_of_multiples(limit, factors)
    sum(x for x in 1:limit-1 if any(x % f == 0 for f in factors if f ≠ 0))
end
```

How does this approach compare to "Approach: summing a set"? Do you think it is more or less understandable? Is it likely to be faster or slower, and if so, for what kinds of inputs do you think it will be faster/slower and why?

Understandability is a matter of opinion and taste, but for me both approaches are understandable.

As for performance, finding the remainders will almost always be a lot slower because it is performing many more iterations of its inner loop (at least once for each of 1:limit-1) and its inner loop is more expensive (CPUs take longer to divide than to add).

When benchmarking, finding the remainders was only faster when when the factors started at 1 (so every value in 1:limit-1 is a factor) or there were an enormous number of repeated factors, which are the worst cases for the summing set approach but are also quite silly inputs. Try the benchmarking code below if you're interested in running your own experiments.

```julia
function sum_of_multiples1(limit, factors)
    multiples = BitSet()
    for f in factors
        f == 0 && continue
        multiple = f
        while multiple < limit
            push!(multiples, multiple)
            multiple += f
        end
    end
    sum(multiples)
end

function sum_of_multiples2(limit, factors)
    sum(x for x in 1:limit-1 if any(x % f == 0 for f in factors if f ≠ 0))
end

using BenchmarkTools

@benchmark sum_of_multiples1(100_000, 2:100) # 700μs
@benchmark sum_of_multiples2(100_000, 2:100) # 7ms (10x slower)

@benchmark sum_of_multiples1(100_000_000, 2:100) # 800ms
@benchmark sum_of_multiples2(100_000_000, 2:100) # 7s (9x slower)

@benchmark sum_of_multiples1(100_000, 1:100) # 900μs
@benchmark sum_of_multiples2(100_000, 1:100) # 500μs (1.8x faster)
```

## Approach: using a wheel

You can also solve this exercise using a technique inspired by [wheel factorisation][wheel].
This solution by cmcaine relies on the observation that the multiples of the factors are a sequence that repeats modulo the product of the factors.
We can then add the entire cycle + offsets to the sum with two additions and a multiplication rather than adding each multiple one at a time.
This solution can be hundreds or thousands of times faster than "Approach: summing a set" when the product of the factors is smaller than the limit and is at worst the same speed as "Approach: summing a set".

The downside, of course, is that this approach is a lot more complicated.

```julia
# Implementation inspired by wheel factorisation.
# We observe that the multiples of the factors is a sequence that repeats with an offset.
# We call the repeating values the `cycle` and the offset is the
# wheel_circumference times the number of cycles we have completed so far.
#
# Finding the the repeating sequence lets us add the sum of the whole sequence
# plus offsets on each iteration, rather than adding each individual value,
# which can make this function much faster than simpler solutions.
function sum_of_multiples(limit, factors)
    factors = filter(≠(0), factors)
    isempty(factors) && return 0

    wheel_circumference = prod(factors)
    if wheel_circumference ≤ 0
        # The product of the factors is way too big (it's overflowed the Int).
        # prod(xs) has the feature that if the result is ≥ 0 it is correct
        # (otherwise some overflow has occurred). This isn't specified in the
        # docstring, so I don't know if it can be relied upon or not.
        cycle_limit = limit
    else
        cycle_limit = min(limit, wheel_circumference + minimum(factors))
    end

    # BitSets are ordered and of course contain only unique values.
    # We rely on both properties below.
    cycle = BitSet()
    for f in factors
        m = f
        while m < cycle_limit
            push!(cycle, m)
            m += f
        end
    end
    cycle_sum = sum(cycle)
    # If we're already at the limit, then we're done
    cycle_limit == limit && return cycle_sum
    # Otherwise use the fast wheel-factorisation approach

    # Add complete cycles + offsets to the accumulator
    acc = 0
    cycles = 0
    cycle_len = length(cycle)
    cycle_max = last(cycle)
    while cycle_max + wheel_circumference * cycles < limit
        acc += cycle_sum + cycle_len * wheel_circumference * cycles
        cycles += 1
    end

    # Add the partial last cycle + offset to the accumulator
    final_offset = wheel_circumference * cycles
    for m in cycle
        m + final_offset < limit || break
        acc += m + final_offset
    end

    return acc
end
```
