# Introduction

## General guidance

It is probably clearest to separate the checks for silence, yelling, and questioning out and give them descriptive names.

## Approach using variables for each check

[4d47's very readable solution](https://exercism.io/tracks/julia/exercises/bob/solutions/bad626f50f3d46999305e1db5d6c8c78)

```julia
function bob(stimulus)
    s = strip(stimulus)
    silence = isempty(s)
    question = endswith(s, '?')
    yelling = s == uppercase(s) && any(isuppercase, s)

    if yelling && question
        "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
    elseif yelling
        "Whoa, chill out!"
    elseif question
        "Sure."
    elseif silence
        "Fine. Be that way!"
    else
        "Whatever."
    end
end
```

## Approach using closures for each check

[cmcaine's solution](https://exercism.io/tracks/julia/exercises/bob/solutions/3f88ebf58eca47fe98c2bc5f20823e45)

```julia
"""
    bob(stimulus)

Bob's lackadaisical response to `stimulus`.

"""
function bob(stimulus)
    is_silence() = all(isspace, stimulus)
    is_yelling() = !any(islowercase, stimulus) && any(isuppercase, stimulus)
    is_question() = last(rstrip(stimulus)) == '?'

    if is_silence()
        "Fine. Be that way!"
    elseif is_yelling()
        if is_question()
            "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
        else
            "Whoa, chill out!"
        end
    elseif is_question()
        "Sure."
    else
        "Whatever."
    end
end
```

The author says:

> Some work can be repeated (`isspace` will be called by both `is_silence` and `rstrip`, and `is_question()` can be called twice), but I like how the work is clearly split into three simple predicates and that there are no intermediate variables.
>
> This function avoids copying the string at any point, too, which is nice for performance.

## Technique: using a map of strings

Some students prefer to collect all of the possible return strings in one place and then refer to them by an ID.
`Bob` is quite a simple exercise, so it doesn't necessarily help much, but in similar functions with more complicated control flow or where you want to support translations or similar, you might want to do this.

Probably the best datatype to use for a small number of strings is a `NamedTuple`. A `Dict` is okay too, but it will be slower.
Use a named tuple like this:

```julia
function bob(stimulus)
    responses = (
        silence = "Fine. Be that way!",
        yelling = "Whoa, chill out!",
        yelling_question = "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!",
        question = "Sure.",
        default = "Whatever.",
    )

    is_yelling = # ...
    is_question = # ...

    if is_yelling && is_question
        return responses.yelling_question
        # or equivalently
        # return responses[:yelling_question]
    end

    # ...
end
```
