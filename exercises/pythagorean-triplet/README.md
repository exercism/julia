# Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

```text
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

## Example
```text
3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.
```

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.
