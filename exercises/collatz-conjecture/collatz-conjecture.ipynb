    "\n",
    "The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is\n",
    "odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely.\n",
    "The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will\n",
    "always reach 1 eventually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. 12\n",
    "1. 6\n",
    "2. 3\n",
    "3. 10\n",

    "7. 4\n",
    "8. 2\n",
    "9. 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.\n",
