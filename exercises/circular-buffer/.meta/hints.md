## Tasks

Define a parametric composite type `CircularBuffer{T}` that holds elements of type `T`, and
write a constructor
```julia
CircularBuffer{T}(capacity::Integer) where {T} -> CircularBuffer{T}
```
that creates an instance that can store up to `capacity` elements.

Extend the following functions from `Base` to work on `CircularBuffer`s:
- `Base.push!(cb::CircularBuffer, item; overwrite::Bool=false)`: Insert the element `item`
  to the end of `cb`, then return `cb`. If `cb` is already full, then throw a `BoundsError`
  if `overwrite` is `false` (the default value); otherwise remove the first element to make
  space for `item` if `overwrite` is `true`.
- `Base.popfirst!(cb::CircularBuffer)`: Remove and return the first element of `cb`.
- `Base.empty!(cb::CircularBuffer)`: Remove all elements from `cb`, then return the empty
  `cb`.

## Bonus tasks

This exercise is quite large and potentially complicated, and that makes it more challenging
and time-consuming to mentor. To help your mentor out, please don't submit code for the
bonus exercises until your mentor has reviewed your solution for the first part of the
exercise.

Extend your `CircularBuffer` to pass tests for `CircularBuffer` from the
[`DataStructures.jl` package](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl/). These
tests are included but disabled in the provided tests for this Exercism exercise; to enable
these tests, add the top-level line `enable_bonus_tests = true` to your file or notebook.

To pass these tests you need to declare `CircularBuffer` as a subtype of
`AbstractVector` and define two functions:
- `capacity(cb::CircularBuffer)`: Return the capacity of `cb`.
- `isfull(cb::CircularBuffer)`: Return `true` is `cb` is full.

Then you must ensure that the following functions from `Base` work correctly with
`CircularBuffer`s: `append!`, `empty!`, `pop!`, `pushfirst`, `setindex!`, `collect`,
`eltype`, `first`, `getindex`, `isempty`, `iterate`, `last`, `length`, and `size`.

Hint: You don't need to—and should not—extend all of these functions! By defining
`CircularBuffer` to be a subtype of `AbstractVector`, generic functions that were defined
for `AbstractVector` will now accept `CircularBuffer` as input. See the section on
[interfaces](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/interfaces/#man-interface-array-1) in
the Julia manual:

> A lot of the power and extensibility in Julia comes from a collection of informal
> interfaces. By extending a few specific methods to work for a custom type, objects of that
> type not only receive those functionalities, but they are also able to be used in other
> methods that are written to generically build upon those behaviors.

You will have to look through the source code for Julia's
[`Base`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tree/master/base) module to see function
definitions and figure out which ones to extend. To locate the relevant code for a function
call, you can use the
[`@which`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/InteractiveUtils/#InteractiveUtils.@which)
macro to identify the specific method to which a function call is dispatched. It also shows
you the file and line number at which that method is defined (in a Jupyter Notebook through
IJulia, it even gives you a link to the relevant code on GitHub).

If you are working at the REPL, you may prefer to use the [`@edit`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/InteractiveUtils/#InteractiveUtils.@edit) macro to open the relevant file and line in your default text editor.
