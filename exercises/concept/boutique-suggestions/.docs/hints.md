# Hints

## 1. Create clothing item

- Some functions can be used with the comprehension syntax to construct them.
- `Dict` is just such a function, review **Generator expressions** in the introduction.
- The category at index `i` matches with the quality at index `i`

## 2. Suggest combinations

- There is a succint syntax for creating multidimensional arrays from a comprehension.
- Review **Multi-variable, multi-dimensional output** in the introduction
- Make sure the order of your iterators (`tops` / `bottoms`) is correct.

## 3. Add up outfit prices

- You will have to access the price from both pieces of clothing and add them together.
- Make sure that the output array shape is the same as the input array shape.
- Review **Single variable** in the introduction.

## 4. Filter out clashing outfits

- You will need to compare the `base_color` from both pieces of clothing and discard the outfits that have the same `base_color`.
- With `Matrix` input, make sure your output is in the most efficient order (i.e. column major).
- Review **Single variable** in the introduction.
