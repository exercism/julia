# Hints

This is a short and simple exercise, so it is best to avoid complicating it.

## 1. Define the rank range

- You need to return a range of integers

## 2. Define the file range

- You need to return a range of uppercase characters.
- Characters use single-quotes, such as `'W'`,

## 3. Transform the rank range into a list of ranks

- The [`collect()`][collect] function is your friend here.

## 4. Transform the file range into a list of files

- See task 3.
