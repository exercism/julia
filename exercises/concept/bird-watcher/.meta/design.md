# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to build on the `vectors` concept by teaching the student more about vector operations in Julia. 

## Learning objectives

- Understand the role of broadcasting in operating on vectors.
- Practice the use of conditional expressions to get a subset of the original vector.

## Out of scope

These will all have separate Concepts:

- `function-composition`
- `higher-order-functions`
- `multiple-dispatch`
  
## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `vector-operations`

## Prerequisites

- `ranges`
