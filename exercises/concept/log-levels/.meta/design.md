# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce the student to strings (mainly ASCII) in Julia.

## Learning objectives

- Understand the principles of string indexing, and a little of how Unicode characters can complicate this.
- Understand splitting and combining strings.
- Become familiar with a basic subset of string functions, such as case changes.

## Out of scope

- Most aspects of Unicode handling (postponed to the `chars` Concept).
- Regular expressions, which have a separate Concept.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `strings`

## Prerequisites

- `ranges`
