# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce the errors and (very basic) logging in Julia.

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to generate a simple `ErrorException`.
- Understand how the `throw()` one of the standard errors.
- Understand something of creating custom errors (though this is not part of the exercise).
- Understand basic `try...catch` blocks.
- Know about logging macros such as `@info`.

## Out of scope

- The exercise does not currently use `try...catch`, because a previous attempt to include it hit testing problems.
- Don't feel we're stopping you if you find a good way to add it.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `errors`

## Prerequisites

- `composite-types`
- `nothingness`
