# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce the student to randomness operations in Julia. 

## Learning objectives

- Konw something about where to find relevant functions:
  - In Base, and always available.
  - in Random, which needs a `using` statement.
  - In other external packages such as Distributions, which are not currently available in Exercism.
- Understand the wide scope and some limitations of the `Base.rand()` function.

## Out of scope

- Most of the functionality in Random, and everything in uninstalled packages, is only briefly mentioned in the concept's `about.md`. 
- Julia has a lot of functions in this area, and we only try to cover a small subset.
  
## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `randomness`

## Prerequisites

- `functions`
