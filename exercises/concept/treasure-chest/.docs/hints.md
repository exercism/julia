# Hints

## 1. Define the TreasureChest type

- The Introduction contains everything you need for this.

## 2. Define the get_treasure() function

- A [ternary operator][ternary] is sufficient.

## 3. Define the multiply_treasure function

- The return value will be a `TreasureChest{Vector{T}}`, where `T` is the type of the treasure in the supplied chest.
  - In the spirit of the concept, you could get the type of the treasure and create a parametric chest with the parameter set to a `Vector` of the original type.
  - Much simpler (perhaps feeling _just a little bit_ like cheating), you could ignore the parameter and let type inference sort it out.
- To create a vector with repeated elements, there are two functions to choose from:
  - [`fill(value, multiplier)`][fill] takes a scalar value and repeats it.
  - [`repeat([value,], multiplier)`][repeat] repeats the given vector.
