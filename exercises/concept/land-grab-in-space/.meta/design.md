# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce the student to composite types (structs) in Julia.

## Learning objectives

- Understand Julia's somewhat muddled terminology: "composite type" in the documentation, "struct" in the code.
- Understand how to define a struct.
- Understand how to define a keyword struct.
- Understand the use of constructors.
- Understand how to create hierarchies of composite types, using abstract types (though this is not currently part of the exercise).

## Out of scope

- Parametric composite types will be covered in a later Concept.
- Inner constructors.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `composite-types`

## Prerequisites

- `types`
