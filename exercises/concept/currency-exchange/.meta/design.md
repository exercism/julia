# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how to use arithmetic operators and type casting between integer and floating point in Julia.

## Learning objectives

- Use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `รท` to add, subtract, multiply, divide numbers(integer and floating point).
- Use `Int()` to cast floating point to integer.
- Use `%` to calculate remainders.
- Use floor division.

## Out of scope

- Details of types, such as `Float32` or `UInt8`.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `conditionals`
- `bitwise-operations`
- `rational-numbers`

## Prerequisites

- `basics`
