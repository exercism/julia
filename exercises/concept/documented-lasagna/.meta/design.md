# Design

## Goal

Students will frequently see docstrings in exemplar solutions, when looking up docs etc.
Therefore it's useful to cover them in a basic exercise.

The concept will also exist as a useful resource to link students to.

## Learning objectives

- Know how to write a docstring for a function.
- Know how to look up docs of a function using the REPL help mode `?`.

## Out of scope

- Exercises should generally not require students to write docstrings; this exercise should make that clear.
- Writing docstrings for functions with many methods, and how to decide which method should be documented.
