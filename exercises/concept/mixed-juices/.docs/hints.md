# Hints

## 1. Determine how long it takes to mix a juice

- Julia has no `switch` statement, in contrast to many other languages.
- The `if` ... `elsefif` ... `else` syntax was covered in the Conditionals concept.

## 2. Replenish the lime wedge supply

- A `while` loop can run until you have enough lime wedges.
- The `popfirst!()` function was covered in the Vectors concept.

## 3. List the times to mix each order in the queue

- Looping over a vector is easy with `for` ... `in`.
- Building a new vector could use `push!()`, which was covered in the Vectors concept.
- Later in the syllabus we will explore various other ways to do this in Julia.

## 4. Finish up the shift

- See task 2.
