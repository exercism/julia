# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of vectors (1-D arrays) in Julia.

## Learning objectives

- Know that a vector is an ordered, homogeneous collection (though the type can be `Any`).
- Know how to create vectors.
- Understand vector indexing
- Know that negative indices are not allowed.
- Know how to modify, insert and delete enties

## Out of scope

These will be covered in the `vector-operations` Concept:

- More complex slicing
- Most other vector operations

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `vectors`

## Prerequisites

- `conditionals`
