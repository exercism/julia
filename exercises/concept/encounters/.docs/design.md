# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce the student to multiple dispatch, Julia's central paradigm.

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to create multiple methods for a function.
- Understand something of how Julia chooses the "best" method to dispatch.
- Understand something of why multiple dispatch is so important in making Julia performant.

## Out of scope

These features are not currently covered, though this could be up for discussion in future.

- Method ambiguity
- Parametric methods

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- None.

## Prerequisites

- `parametric-types`

## Source

This exercise is based on an example used in the talk "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Multiple Dispatch" given by Stefan Karpinski at JuliaCon 2019, available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/kc9HwsxE1OY?t=422).
