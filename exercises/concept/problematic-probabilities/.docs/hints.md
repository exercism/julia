# Hints

## 1. Give the ratio of successes to trials

- Create `Rational` numbers using the successes as the numerator and the trials as the denominator.
- Loops, comprehensions or vector operations can be employed to create the new array.

## 2. Find the real probabilities associated with successes to trials

- Create `Float` numbers using the successes as the numerator and the trials as the denominator.
- Loops, comprehensions or vector operations can be employed to create the new array.

## 3. Check the mean of the probabilities

- The mean is found by summing the data and dividing by the number of events.
- Use your `rationalize` and `probabilities` functions.
- If a discrepancy is found between using floats and rationals, return the rational number.
- The `float()` function may be needed in the comparison (see the introduction).
- Loops or vector operations can be employed.

## 4. Check the independent probability

- Probabilities of independent events can be multiplied together to find the total probability of those events happening together.
- Use your `rationalize` and `probabilities` functions.
- If a discrepancy is found between using floats and rationals, return the rational number.
- Loops or vector operations can be employed.
