# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of Sets in Julia.

## Learning objectives

-  understand that a set is an --unordered collection of distinct hashable objects--
-  create a `Set` via constructor (`Set()`)
-  de-dupe a list of elements by converting a sequence type such as a `vector` to a `set` type
-  check for a membership of an element in a given set via `in`
-  set comparison functions and set comparison operators
-  additional set operators (`union`, `intersect`, `setdiff`, and `symdiff`)
-  add values to a given set via `push!()`
-  remove values from a given set via `delete!()`
-  iterate through a given set by using `for item in <set>`

## Out of scope

- Set comprehensions.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `sets`

## Prerequisites

- `loops`
