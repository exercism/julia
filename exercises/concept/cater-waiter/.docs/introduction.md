# Introduction

A [`Set`][set] is a collection of items with the following properties:

- Unordered.
- Entries are unique, so attempts to add duplicates are silently ignored.
- Supports many of the operations common with mathematical sets.

Create them with the `Set()` constructor, using any iterator as the parameter.

```julia-repl
julia> s1 = Set(1:4)
Set([4, 2, 3, 1])
```

Add new elements with `push!()` (the same as with arrays), and remove them with `delete!()`.

```julia-repl
julia> push!(s1, 5)
Set([5, 4, 2, 3, 1])

# Duplicates are ignored
julia> push!(s1, 3)
Set([5, 4, 2, 3, 1])

julia> delete!(s1, 5)
Set([4, 2, 3, 1])

julia> length(s1)  # length counts entries, despite the non-sequential type
4
```

## Set operations

As with several other collection types, check membership with the `in` or `∈` operator (use `\in` then tab for the symbol).

```julia-repl
julia> 3 ∈ s1
true
```

The following operations on pairs of Sets are supported (shortcuts to the operator symbol are shown in parentheses).

- `union(A, B)` or `A ∪ B` (`\cup`): all entries in A or B or both.
- `intersect(A, B)` or `A ∩ B` (`\cap`): all entries common to both A and B.
- `setdiff(A, B)` (no symbol): entries in A but not in B.
- `symdiff(A, B)` (no symbol): entries in either A or B but not both.
- `issubset(A, B)` or `A ⊆ B` (`\subseteq`) or `B ⊇ A` (`\supseteq`): `true` if all entries in A are also in B.
- `issetequal(A, B)` (no symbol): `true` if A and B contain exactly the same entries.
- `isdisjoint(A, B)` (no symbol): `true` if A and B contain no entries in common (so intersect is empty).

```julia-repl
julia> s1 = Set(1:4);
julia> s2 = Set(3:6);
julia> s1 ∪ s2  # union
Set([5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1])

julia> s1 ∩ s2  # intersect
Set([4, 3])
  
julia> setdiff(s1, s2)
Set([2, 1])

julia> symdiff(s1, s2)
Set([5, 6, 2, 1])
  
julia> s1 ⊇ s2  # issubset
false
```

There are also mutating versions of many of these, with `!` added to the function name.
See the [manual][set] for a full list of functions.
