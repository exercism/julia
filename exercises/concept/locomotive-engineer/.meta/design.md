# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to learn more about functions in Julia.

## Learning objectives

- Understand that a function definition can be of 3 types: multi-line, assignment-style, or anonymous.
- Understand optional arguments.
- Understand keyword arguments.
- Understand and practice splat and slurp, for both positional and keyword arguments.

## Out of scope

- Multiple Dispatch will be a later concept.
- Higher Order Funtions are only briefly mentioned, and will be the subject of a later concept.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `function-composition`
- `higher-order-functions`
- `multiple-dispatch`
- `complex-numbers` (probably?)

## Prerequisites

- `vector-operations`
- `pairs-and-dicts`
