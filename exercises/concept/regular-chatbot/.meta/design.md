# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how to use PCRE2-flavor regular expressions in Julia.

## Learning objectives

- Understand that Julia uses the popular and standard PCRE2 library.
- Understand that String functions are often really Regex functions, such as `occursin`.
- Understand `match` and `eachmatch` for captures: there is no `g` flag for global search.
- Understand something about `replace` syntax with captures.
  
## Out of scope

- Teaching standard Regex syntax: _go online for that, we provide links_.

## Concepts

- `regular-expressions`

## Prerequisites

- `nothingness`
