# Hints

This exercise is centered around a keyword composite type with type unions.

## 1. Define type unions

- See the example where a type was named.

## 2. Implement the Player composite type

- All fields should be *annotated with types*, two of which with type unions.
- See the `Node` example in the introduction for a concrete example of fields annotated with types.
- All fields should have the default values listed in the instructions.

## 3. Introduce yourself

- A [ternary operator][control-flow] can be used for a one line solution.
- The `ismissing` function is useful here.

## 4. Implement increment methods

- The arguments of the methods need to be annotated with the correct types.
- See further examples of argument annotation in the introduction.
- [Ternary operators][control-flow] can also be used here for one line solutions.
- It may be helpful to study/review the Concept on `Multiple Dispatch` if needed.

## 5. Implement the title function

- Use your `increment` function.
- A [ternary operator][control-flow] can be used for a one line solution.

## 6. Implement the revive function

- Use your `increment` function.
- Return a modified player if they were dead, or an unmodified player if they were alive.
