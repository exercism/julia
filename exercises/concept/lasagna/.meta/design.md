# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the fundamentals of the `basics` Concept in Julia, so that they are able to understand the basic structure of Exercism exercises.

## Learning objectives

- Know the two common ways to define a named function.
  - `f(x) = ...`, `function f(x) ... end`
- Know how to call a function.
- Know about implicit `return`s.
- Know how to define an integer.
- Know how to define a global constant.
- Know how to use mathematical operators on integers.

## Out of scope

Everything beyond the simplest minimum for the first exercise of a novice.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise practices are:

- `basics`: Defining a constant. Defining a function with one or more positional arguments that returns something. Bare minimum to be able to understand the basic structure of Exercism exercises.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.
