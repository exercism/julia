Furthermore, on the Julia-specific repos and website sections, do not sexualize or genderize the term "Julia" or any other aspects of the project.
While "Julia" is a female name in many parts of the world, the programming language is not a person and does not have a gender. 

In natural languages where attaching a grammatical gender to the name "Julia" is unavoidable, exceptions may be made.
However, consider using language constructs such as "the programming language Julia" and then referring to "the programming language" whenever possible.
