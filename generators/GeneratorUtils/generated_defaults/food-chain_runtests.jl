# JSON doesn't allow for multi-line strings, so all verses are presented 
# here as arrays of strings. It's up to the test generator to join the 
# lines together with line breaks.
# Some languages test for the verse() method, which takes a start verse 
# and optional end verse, but other languages have only tested for the full poem.
# For those languages in the latter category, you may wish to only 
# implement the full song test and leave the rest alone, ignoring the start 
# and end verse fields.
