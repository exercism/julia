# About

True or false values are represented by the `Bool` type.
It contains only two values: `true` and `false`.

`Bool` is a subtype of `Integer` and acts as `1` and `0` numerically:

```julia
help?> Bool
```

```
Bool <: Integer
```

Boolean type, containing the values `true` and `false`.

`Bool` is a kind of number: `false` is numerically equal to `0` and `true` is numerically equal to `1`. Moreover, `false` acts as a multiplicative "strong zero":

```jldoctest
julia> false == 0
true

julia> true == 1
true

julia> 0 * NaN
NaN

julia> false * NaN
0.0
```

Be aware that the behaviour of `false` as a strong zero may not be  consistent and intuitive in all situations.
See [julialang/julia#33226](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/33226) for more information.
