# Introduction

This is a _big_ subject!
It is possible to write a long book about it, and several people have done so (search Amazon for "unicode book" to see some examples).

## A very brief history

Handling characters in computers was much simpler in earlier decades, when programmers assumed that English was the only important language.
So: 26 letters, upper and lower case, 10 digits, several punctuation marks, plus a code (0x07) to ring a bell, and it all fitted into 7 bits: the ASCII character set.

Naturally, people started asking what about à, ä and Ł, then other people started asking about ऄ, ஹ and ญ, and young people wanted emojis 😱.
What to do?

To cut a long story short, many smart and patient people had to serve on committees for years, working out the details of the Unicode character set, and of encodings such as UTF-8, and lots of software needed a _very_ complicated rewrite.
Also, lots of new bugs were introduced.

To prevent _everything_ breaking, the Unicode/UTF-8 design ensures that the first 127 codes are identical to ASCII _(even the bell)_.

## Characters in Julia

Languages designed after about 2005 have the huge advantage that a reasonably stable Unicode standard already existed.

Julia (first released 2012) was able to assume that everything would be Unicode: characters, strings, variable and function names, mathematical operators...

To quote the manual, "Julia makes dealing with plain ASCII text simple and efficient, and handling Unicode is as simple and efficient as possible."
Note the "as possible", it is an important part of the statement.

***Character literals are written in single-quotes, and are distinct from strings written in double quotes.***

This is obvious to people from the C/C++ world, but potentially confusing to Python and Javascript programmers.

```julia-repl
julia> a = 'a'  # Roman alphabet
'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> typeof(a)
Char

julia> jha = 'झ'  # Devanagari alphabet
'झ': Unicode U+091D (category Lo: Letter, other)

julia> typeof(jha)
Char

julia> '❤'  # heart emoji
'❤': Unicode U+2764 (category So: Symbol, other)
```

We can see from the examples that the type is `Char`, and Julia has further information about the category of character.

Looking closer, it appears that these characters can be represented by 4 hexadecimal digits.
The full character set needs up to 6 hex digits.

These numbers are called "code points", and currently range from U+0000 to U+10FFFF.
They display in the REPL, but within code use `codepoints()` to obtain them.

Converting between `Char` and `Int` is simple:

```julia-repl
julia> Int('a')
97

julia> Char(97)
'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

The compiler allows _some_ forms of integer arithmetic on `Char`s:

```julia-repl
julia> 'b' - 'a'  # interval, in alphabetic order
1

julia> 'b' + 'a'
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching +(::Char, ::Char)

julia> 'a' + 5
'f': ASCII/Unicode U+0066 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> 'f' + ('A' - 'a')  # same as `uppercase('f')`
'F': ASCII/Unicode U+0046 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```

## Functions for characters

Many string-handling functions can also work on `Char` input.

- For appropriate alphabets, change case with `uppercase()` and `lowercase()`.
- Test case with `isuppercase()` and `islowercase()`.
- Test character type with:
  - `isletter()` covers many alphabets
  - `isdigit()`, tests for strictly 0:9
  - `isnumeric()`, broader than `isdigit`, so `true` for ¾ and various non-European scripts
  - `isxdigit()`, hexadecimal digits
  - `isascii()`, pre-Unicode character
  - `ispunct()`, punctuation
  - `isspace()`, any whitespace character
  - `isprint()`, printable characters (opposite is `iscntrl()`)

```julia
islowercase('A')  # false
uppercase('γ')  # 'Γ': Unicode U+0393 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
ispunct('@')  # true
isdigit('A')  # false
isxdigit('A')  # true
```

## Char Vector and String interconversions

For String to Char Vector, we can use `collect()`.

For Char Vector to String, there is the `String()` constructor.

```julia-repl
julia> s = "abcde"
"abcde"

julia> cv = collect(s)
5-element Vector{Char}:
 'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'b': ASCII/Unicode U+0062 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'c': ASCII/Unicode U+0063 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'd': ASCII/Unicode U+0064 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'e': ASCII/Unicode U+0065 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> String(cv)
"abcde"
```

This works with any characters, not just ASCII.

```julia-repl
julia> collect("❤,😱")
3-element Vector{Char}:
 '❤': Unicode U+2764 (category So: Symbol, other)
 ',': ASCII/Unicode U+002C (category Po: Punctuation, other)
 '😱': Unicode U+1F631 (category So: Symbol, other)
```

Note that the `String()` constructor operates on a Vector.
To _cast_ a single `Char` to a 1-character string, the function is `string()`, with lowercase `s`.

```julia-repl
julia> string('a')
"a"
```

## Storage

Everything so far in the document seems relatively simple, so is there really not much to worry about?

Unfortunately, this is too optimistic!

One complication comes from the need for "up to" 6 hex digits per code point.
This means that different characters need different amounts of space in memory when UTF-8 encoded.

A byte can only store (unsigned) numbers up to 255, two hex digits, so UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes (1 to 4) to store a `Char`.
These are called "code units", and the `ncodeunits()` function will return the number needed for a given character.

```julia-repl
julia> codepoint(jha)  # jha 'झ' is defined in an earlier example
0x0000091d

julia> ncodeunits(jha)
3

julia> ncodeunits('a')  # ASCII character
1

julia> ncodeunits('😱')  # emoji
4
```

Also, not everything that can be displayed on screen has its own unique code point.
Some visually-distinct characters are considered to be derived from others, so Unicode treats them as a parent character plus a modifier.
