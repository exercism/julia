# About

A central aim of Julia is to be able to perform calculations on numerical data, quickly and efficiently.
_Lots_ of numerical data.

Typically, the data will be stored in arrays (or some related type), so it is reasonable to say that arrays are at the heart of the Julia language.

Arrays can be of arbitrary size (subject only to memory constraints in your hardware), and can have arbitrarily many dimensions.

Some types of arrays have special names (copied from Linear Algebra).
A 1-Dimensional array is called a `Vector` and a 2-dimensional array is called a `Matrix`.
Both are subtypes of `Array` in Julia.

This introductory Concept concentrates on the basics of Vectors.
Higher-dimensional arrays will be covered later in the syllabus.

## Creating Vectors

In Julia, a [Vector][arrays] is an ordered sequence of values that can be accessed by index number.

The simplest way to create a Vector is to list the values in square brackets:

```julia-repl
julia> num_vec = [1, 4, 9]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 9

julia> str_vec = ["arrays", "are", "important"]
3-element Vector{String}:
 "arrays"
 "are"
 "important"
```

The Vector type matches the type of each element.

Technically, it is a _column_ vector, but please ignore that for now if you are unfamiliar with Linear Algebra.
It should make more sense after the Multidimensional Arrays concept.

_So Vectors need to be homogeneous (all elements the same type)?_

At some level, yes â€” and it is recommended to aim for this if you want the best performance.
However, Julia can work round this limitation (when necessary) by using the `Any` type:

```julia-repl
julia> mixed_vector = [1, "str", 'c']
3-element Vector{Any}:
 1
  "str"
  'c': ASCII/Unicode U+0063 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

### Pre-filled Vectors

It is very common to start from vectors of all-0 or all-1 values. For these, there are functions called (unsurprisingly) `zeros()` and `ones()`, which take the vector size as a parameter.
The default type is Float64, but other numeric types can optionally be specified.

By extension, the `fill()` function takes both a value to repeat, and the desired vector size.

```julia-repl
julia> zeros(3)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0
 0.0
 0.0

julia> ones(3)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 1.0
 1.0

julia> ones(Int64, 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 1

julia> fill(42, 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 42
 42
 42
```

There are many other options: see [the manual][prefilled].

# Indexing

Please read and remember this rule:

- ***By default, indexing in Julia starts at 1, not 0***.

This is familiar to anyone who has used other data science languages (R, Matlab, Fortran...), but may seem shocking to computer scientists with a background in C-like languages.

Otherwise, indexes work as you might guess: just put them in square brackets:

```julia
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
squares[1]  # 0
squares[3]  # 4
squares[begin]  # 0 ("begin" is synonym for 1)
squares[end]  # 16 ("end" is synonym for length(squares))
```

Note the convenience of indexing with `end` (which is very useful) and `begin` (which is probably not).

Python programmers may be wondering about negative indices.
Don't: these are not part of Julia, and will raise a `BoundsError`, as will any index smaller than 1 or bigger than `length(squares)`.

## Vector operations

Vectors in Julia are _mutable_: we can change the contents of individual cells.

```julia-repl
julia> vals = [1, 3, 5, 7]
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7

julia> vals[2] = 4  # reassign the value of this element
4

# Only the value at position 2 changes:
julia> vals
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 5
 7
```

There are many [functions available][dequeue] for manipulating vectors, though the Julia documentation generalizes them to "collections" rather than vectors.

Note that, by convention, functions that mutate their input have `!` in the name.
The compiler will not enforce this, but it is a very _strong_ convention in the Julia world.

These are a few of the useful functions:

- To add values to the end of the vector, use [`push!()`][push].
- To remove the last value, use [`pop!()`][pop].
- To operate on the start of the vector, the corresponding functions are [`pushfirst!()`][pushfirst] and [`popfirst!()`][popfirst].
- To insert or remove an element at any position, there is [`insert!()`][insert] and [`deleteat!()`][deleteat].

```julia-repl
julia> vals = [1, 3]
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3

julia> push!(vals, 5, 6)  # can add multiple values
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 6

julia> pop!(vals)  # mutates vals, return popped value
6

julia> vals
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
```

## Concatenation

Concatenation is fairly simple for vectors, though a glance at the manual gives warning of complexities in store when we consider multidimensional arrays.

The [`append!()][append] function can take a mixture of several vectors and single elements as input.

```julia-repl
julia> append!([1, 2], [3, 4], [-1, -2], 15)
7-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
 -1
 -2
 15
```
