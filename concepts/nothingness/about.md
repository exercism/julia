# About

Many languages have a way such as `null` or `none` to indicate a non-existent value.
Because Julia is designed to handle large volumes of (often messy) data, it has multiple forms of [nothingness][nothingness].

The overall aim is to flag missing or suspect values as they are encountered, then continue without raising an exception.

## `nothing`

If a value really does not exist, it is represented by [`nothing`][nothing]. This is probably closest to what C (`NULL`) or Python (`None`) might do.

```julia-repl
julia> n = nothing

julia> isnothing(n)
true

julia> typeof(n)
Nothing
```

So `nothing` is a singleton value of type `Nothing`, and we can test for it.

One common use of `nothing` is as a return (non-)value for functions which are used only for their side effects (printing, network configuration, or whatever).

## `missing`

For situations where a value exists in theory but we don't know what it is, [`missing`][missing] is used. For example, when counting vehicles traveling on a road, human observers might need a break or automatic sensors break down, but the traffic continues to flow.

Thus `missing` is a placeholder, warning humans that they need to make a decision about how to handle this gap in the data.

```julia-repl
julia> mv = [1, 2, missing]
3-element Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}}:
 1
 2
  missing

julia> typeof(mv)
Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}} (alias for Array{Union{Missing, Int64}, 1})

julia> ismissing.(mv)  # broadcast function, displays as 1 for true, 0 for false
3-element BitVector:
 0
 0
 1
```

Few other languages have this feature built in, but close analogues are `NA` in R or `NULL` in SQL.

The vector type in the example above is set to `Union{Missing, Int64}`, which has some similarity to types such as `Option` or `Maybe` in other languages.

Expressions usually return `missing` by default if `missing` values are present.
If you want these values to be ignored, use the [`skipmissing()`][skipmissing] function to make this explicit:

```julia-repl
julia> mv = [1, 2, missing]
3-element Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}}:
 1
 2
  missing

julia> sum(mv)  # missing in, missing out
missing

julia> skipmissing(mv)
skipmissing(Union{Missing, Int64}[1, 2, missing])

julia> collect(skipmissing(mv))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> sum(skipmissing(mv))  # functions like sum() can work with iterators
3
```

Because `skipmissing` creates an iterator, wrap it in [`collect()`][collect] if you need a vector.

Sometimes it is useful to replace `missing` values with some default.
The [`@coalesce()`][coalesce] macro is useful for this, as it will return the first non-missing value (or `missing` if there is nothing else).

```julia-repl
julia> str = ["I", "exist", missing]
3-element Vector{Union{Missing, String}}:
 "I"
 "exist"
 missing

julia> [@coalesce(s, "-") for  s in str]
3-element Vector{String}:
 "I"
 "exist"
 "-"
```

## `NaN`

Short for "Not a Number", [NaN][NaN] flags a computation problem in situations where a number was expected.

```julia-repl
julia> v = [0, 1, -1]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  0
  1
 -1

julia> v / 0
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 NaN
  Inf
 -Inf
 
julia> sum(v / 0)
NaN
```

Any sort of calculation on data including a NaN will give a `NaN` result.

There is currently no special function to remove `NaN` values, but the standard [`filter()`][filter] function can do this quite simply.
Only values for which some given condition is `true` will be copied to the result array:

```julia-repl
julia> filter(!isnan, [1, 2, NaN])
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 2.0
```

## Undefined data

This is something you are likely use less frequently.
Exceptions include:
- There are ways to create composite types (such as [`struct`][struct]) with uninitialized fields.
Julia usually tries to use default values, but can only do this if it has enough information to infer the field type.
- In some cases, initializing a vector as `undef` can be a flexible and performant approach.
This has been used, for example, in community solutions to the [Circular Buffer][circbuff] exercise (an advanced technique, but this is graded as a hard exercise).

Getting an [`undef`][undef] result from an attempt to access a value is an error state, typically flagged with an [`UndefRefError`][UndefRefError].
