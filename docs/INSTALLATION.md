# Installation

To install Julia on your system follow the instructions on the [Julia Language Downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

~~~~exercism/caution
It is not recommended to install Julia through your operating system's package manager.
Those packages are not officially maintained and may cause issues.

For a local installation, there are plugins for a large number of editors/IDEs available.
The [VS Code extension](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode) is the most popular one.
You can find integrations for other editors in the [JuliaEditorSupport](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport) organisation on GitHub.

If you prefer a more interactive environment, you can use Jupyter notebooks with [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), or use [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) for simple reactive notebooks in Julia.

A simple way to get started with Julia without the need of a local installation is [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/), a notebook-based online IDE.
You can access it from your browser, login and you start solving exercises.
If you just want an online REPL, you can use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/julia).
